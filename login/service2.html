                <p>
                    Teeth whitening is the process of using bleach or other materials to make teeth look whiter. The materials remove stains or other discoloration from the tooth surface.

                <p style="font-weight: bold;padding-bottom: 0;">Pre-consultation / Clinical examination and diagnostic information collection</p>
                <p>Clinical examination and interviews for patients who visit the clinic regarding the teeth and facial factors will be conducted to check their oral health including cavities, gum conditions, and teeth alignment.</p>    
                <p style="font-weight: bold;padding-bottom: 0;">Data analysis and diagnosis</p>
                <p>
                    A second follow-up stage will allow us to compile the data to establish the most appropriate treatment plan.
                    In-depth medical examination for an accurate diagnosis is taken based on various diagnostic procedures, including Cephalometric and panoramic X-rays, mouth and face pictures, and plaster casts of the mouth</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold;padding-bottom: 0;">2nd Consultation</p>
                <p>Based on the data collected, the issues are diagnosed and analyzed. Then, a detailed treatment plan, treatment period, type of brace to be used, and estimated cost are decided.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;padding-bottom: 0;">Treatment Process</p>
                <p>The treatment begins when orthodontic appliances are mounted based on the treatment plan.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;padding-bottom: 0;">Maintenance appliances after orthodontic treatment</p>
                <p>Right after orthodontic appliance removal, it is necessary to wear a retainer for a certain period of time to help maintain your teeth and prevent any future misalignment.</p>

                <h2>When whitening is not recommended</h2>
                <p>If you have gum disease (also known as periodontal disease), you may not be an ideal candidate for braces. Gum disease occurs when the tissue that supports your teeth becomes infected. Often this is because of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that builds up on your teeth. Gum disease is usually painless, but your dentist can spot it. </p>
